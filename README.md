### Introduction

I got an original Muse headband (v2, 2016) and have used it some for my mindfulness practice. Most of my mindfulness practice has been attempts to be present in the moment to moment of every day life. There is a human bias called the [context effect and mood-congruent memory bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue-dependent_forgetting) where we can't remember things when we are in a different context, or it is easier to remember something when it is congruent with our current mood. So if we do all our mindfulness practice sitting down and being quite, we won't remember to pay attention to ourselves and our surroundings when something else is happening in life. This is at least true for me, so I practice all the time, as often as I can remember in all cirumstances.

I'm also a searcher after truth, and some of the best ways we humans have found to understand something is by building machines that can measure reality. So I got one and am going to play around with reading some data I gather and see what I can find. I can make all sorts of hypotheses and test them, or I can just explore the data and try a lot of different strange things until I run across something interesting. I will probably do both. \^\_\^

### Further Steps

I'm planning to explore what scripting languages I can use to explore the different aspects of brain scans I take. I suspect I will end up using Python for this. Then I'm going to start making a few simple scripts to look at what is going on with my brain when I'm doing different things. These scripts may turn into a generalized program to explore brain activity.

I also need to keep taking more scans and collecting more data. I will start with me, but then I will move onto scans from other people and see if there is anything I can learn about how neural oscillations work.

I'm going to start with [PyMUSE](https://github.com/ismaelpessa/PyMUSE) (tried [pyMuse](https://github.com/PolyCortex/pyMuse) but it had issues with it's requirements), make a smol script to look at some differences in brain wave activity for different activities or before and after reading from muse guided mindfulness practice. Once I get that working, I may start explore more complex code bases and see what I can do with tools like [mne-python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python).
